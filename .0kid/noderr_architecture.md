# Noderr Architecture

## Library Constraints
- Canonical index: .0kid/docs/index.json
- Detailed constraints: [.0kid/library_constraints.md](.0kid/library_constraints.md)
- Policy: Each library must include USAGE.md and PITFALLS.md; code must follow allowed patterns; forbidden patterns trigger QA gate.
