# Library Constraints

## Purpose
This document defines the approved libraries, usage constraints, and banned patterns for the Kid methodology. All library usage must comply with these constraints to pass QA gates.

## Approved Libraries
*(To be populated by dependency-docs-harvester)*

- Document approved libraries with version ranges
- Include usage guidelines and best practices
- Link to corresponding `.0kid/docs/<library>/` documentation

## Constraints
*(To be populated by dependency-docs-harvester)*

- Performance constraints and memory limits
- Security requirements and vulnerability thresholds
- Compatibility requirements across target environments
- License compatibility requirements

## Banned Patterns
*(To be populated by dependency-docs-harvester)*

- Anti-patterns that trigger QA gate failures
- Deprecated APIs and unsafe practices
- Libraries with known security vulnerabilities
- Patterns that violate architectural principles

## Usage
This document should be referenced from the main architecture documentation and enforced by QA gates during implementation phases.
