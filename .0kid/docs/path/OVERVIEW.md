- License: Node.js core (MIT)
- Version: unknown

Overview:
The `path` module provides utilities for handling and transforming file paths in a cross-platform way, including joining, resolving, normalizing, and parsing path components.

Scope notes:
- Built into Node.js; no separate installation.
- Use `path.posix` / `path.win32` for explicit platform semantics when needed.
