# fs

- What: Node.js core module for filesystem operations (sync/async APIs for files, directories, streams, watchers).
- License: Node.js core (MIT)
- Version: unknown
- Runtime: Node.js

Overview:
The `fs` module provides APIs to read, write, copy, move, and inspect files and directories, supporting callback, Promise, and synchronous variants. It also integrates with streams and file watching for efficient I/O.

Scope notes:
- Built into Node.js; no separate installation.
- Use `fs/promises` for modern async/await flows.
